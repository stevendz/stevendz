## ❤ to Build - Life is better when you’re smiling!

Hi, I'm Steven - a **mobile developer and engineer** from Hamburg.   
I fell in love with Flutter over one year ago now and have spent more than 700 hours in studying this framework. 
My working principle is learning by doing.   
Always up for a discussion on the newest mobile framworks and trends with a cold beer. 🍻

### I work on ... 💻
Flutter | React.js | Vue.js

Firebase | Google Cloud | MongoDB

Dart | JavaScript | C#

### My absolute favorites ... 💖
🦄 I love CODING  

👨‍💻 I BUILD beautiful and intuitive apps  

👨‍🏫 Just as much as I love IMPROVEMENT, I also love HELPING everyone on their way  

🎥 Making VIDEOS on YouTube is a nice pastime for me (and will help others)
