## ❤ to Build - Life is better when you’re smiling!

Hi, I'm Steven - a **mobile developer and engineer** from Hamburg.   
I fell in love with Flutter over one year ago now and have spent more than 700 hours in studying this framework. 
My working principle is learning by doing.   
Always up for a discussion on the newest mobile framworks and trends with a cold beer. 🍻

### I work on ... 💻
Flutter | React.js | Vue.js

Firebase | Google Cloud | MongoDB

Dart | JavaScript | C#

### My absolute favorites ... 💖
🦄 I love CODING  

👨‍💻 I BUILD beautiful and intuitive apps  

👨‍🏫 Just as much as I love IMPROVEMENT, I also love HELPING everyone on their way

### You know you’re a programmer ... 🚀
– when you spend a day to find the problem and you fix it with one line of code.

– when your code works and you have no idea why.

– when you fix one bug and get 100 new ones.
