## ❤ to Build - Life is better when you’re smiling!
Hi, I'm Steven - a **mobile developer and engineer** from Hamburg.  
I fell in love with Flutter over one year ago now and have spent more than 700 hours in studying this framework.   
To deepen my technical knowledge, I completed the 'Neue Fische' Bootcamp and gained over 540 hours of experience within the MERN-stack.   
There is no challenge I am afraid of and I love to reach my limits, just to exceed them the next day. A day without improvement can't be a successful day.

### You know you’re a programmer ... 🚀
– when you spend a day to find the problem and you fix it with one line of code.

– when your code works and you have no idea why.

– when you fix one bug and get 100 new ones.

### Ask me about ... 💭
Whatever you want to know :)
